## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to...
 
- How do people's political beliefs change over time? Are people more likely to agree with Democrats when they're young and change their minds as they age? Or do people generally stay in the same party as they age, and the Republican share of the vote increases with age because previous non-voters begin to vote?

- How well do your parents' beliefs predict your beliefs?

- Is the number of different news sources consumed by a voter predictive of their political party?
